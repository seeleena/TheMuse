    <blockquote>
        <p>The CAT is based on the idea that the best measure of creativity of an artifact is the
        combined assessment of experts in that field.  It does not use a checklist or apply a general 
        assessment rubric. Instead, the field expert rates the artifact within a range, for example, 1 to 5,
        but should ensure that the full range is used in the assessment. The rating is based on the judge's
        sense of what is creative in their domain. The goal is to get ratings of the comparative
        creativity of the artifacts. Thus, the ratings can only be compared within the pool of artifacts judged
        by a particular panel of experts.</p>
        <p>CAT therefore, is a norm-referenced rating based on comparisons within the group of creations being judged.
        Since some groups will have higher levels of creativity that others, to avoid unfair assessments,
        a sample of already assessed artifacts are made available to you.</p>
