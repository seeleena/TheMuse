    </div>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
        You must choose the method with which you will assess the creativity of the assignment solution.
        The two methods to choose from are the CAT - Consensual Assessment Technique, and the CSGS - Creative
        Solution Diagnosis Scale. See below for further details.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 class='elgg-heading-main'>Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT)</h3><br/>
    <div class="background">
        <p>The CAT is based on the idea that the best measure of creativity of an artifact is the
        combined assessment of experts in that field.  It does not use a checklist or apply a general 
        assessment rubric. Instead, the field expert rates the artifact within a range, for example, 1 to 5,
        but should ensure that the full range is used in the assessment. The rating is based on the judge's
        sense of what is creative in their domain. The goal is to get ratings of the comparative
        creativity of the artifacts. Thus, the ratings can only be compared within the pool of artifacts judged
        by a particular panel of experts.</p>
        <p>CAT therefore, is a norm-referenced rating based on comparisons within the group of creations being judged.
        Since some groups will have higher levels of creativity that others, to avoid unfair assessments,
        a sample of already assessed artifacts are made available to you.</p>
    </div><br/>
    <h3 class='elgg-heading-main'>Creative Solution Diagnosis Scale</h3><br/>
    <div class="background"><p>The CSDS is a 24 item scale used to judge a product's creativity. The items
        are broad properties of products that can be used to describe the level and kind of creativity they possess.
        They are 'indicators' of creativity. The 24 items are based on 5 core criteria: Relevance & 
        Effectiveness, Problematization, Propulsion, Elegance, and Genesis.</p>
        <p>The CAT has been tested mostly on the artefacts of the 'soft' sciences. Whereas, the CSDS
        is an assessment instrument designed for the 'hard' sciences. Additionally, the CSDS is 
        a reliable instrument for non-expert judgments of creativity. This is useful in cases where multiple
        experts are not available, as is required in the CAT. The CSDS is a criterion-referenced rating of creativity.</p>
    </div><br/>
    <h3 class='elgg-heading-main'>Creativity Criteria</h3><br/>
    <div class="background"><p>The Creativity criteria is a list of criteria that can be used to assess
        students' creative process. These criteria were taken from Creativity literature and can be used
        as a guide in thinking about how creative a student's process is in terms of the given assignment.</p>
        <p>The criteria are:
        <ol><li>Evidence of divergent thinking - generation of numerous quality ideas & alternatives.</li>
            <li>Evidence of convergent thinking - combination or integration of elements in new ways. Associative thinking.</li>
            <li>Evidence of logical and not so logical thinking used, connected & integrated.</li>
            <li>Evidence of documented intuition.</li>
            <li>Use of knowledge & understanding applied to coursework context.</li>
            <li>Critical thinking, including unlearning, relearning and new learning.</li>
            <li>Evidence of documented reflection.</li>
            <li>Justification of solutions and ideas.</li>
            <li>Drawing previously unrecognized parallels between models, topics & situations.</li>
            <li>Recognition of creativity in others. Responsiveness to ideas of others.</li>
            <li>Sense making.</li>
            <li>Evidence of fluency in communication via clear & concise writing, drawings and models.</li>

Relevance & Effectiveness - Knowledge of existing facts and principles
    PERFORMANCE (the solution does what it is supposed to do) 
    APPROPRIATENESS (the solution fits within task constraints) 
    CORRECTNESS (the solution accurately reflects conventional knowledge and/or techniques) 
Problematization - Solution draws attention to problems in what already exists
    PRESCRIPTION (the solution shows how existing solutions could be improved) 
    PROGNOSIS (the solution helps the beholder to anticipate likely effects of changes) 
    DIAGNOSIS (the solution draws attention to shortcomings in other existing solutions)
Propulsion - Solution propels the field including the known is seen in a new way, transferred to a new setting, extended in a new direction or new approach.
    REDEFINITION (the solution helps the beholder see new and different ways of using the solution) 
    REINITIATION (the solution indicates a radically new approach) 
    GENERATION (the solution offers a fundamentally new perspective on possible solutions)
    REDIRECTION (the solution shows how to extend the known in a new direction)
